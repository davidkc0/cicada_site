                    Apple had a successful third quarter in 2024, with net sales increasing by 5% compared to the same period in 2023. This growth was driven by strong performance in the Americas, Europe, and Rest of Asia Pacific regions, as well as higher net sales of Services and iPad. However, net sales in Greater China decreased due to lower net sales of iPhone.<br><br>The company's gross margin percentage increased slightly during the third quarter of 2024 compared to the same period in 2023, primarily due to cost savings and a different product mix. Services gross margin percentage also increased during the third quarter of 2024 compared to the same period in 2023, primarily due to a different services mix.<br><br>Total operating expenses grew by 17% during the third quarter of 2024 compared to the same period in 2023, driven by increases in research and development, and selling, general and administrative expenses.
